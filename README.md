# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

`# Personalized Email Outreach Frontend

Welcome to the frontend of the "Personalized Email Outreach" project. This frontend is built using React and provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their email prompts, generate personalized email content, and view the results.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up and running the frontend, please ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the frontend:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/personalized-email-frontend.git`

1.  Navigate to the Frontend Directory:

    Change your current directory to the frontend folder:

    shellCopy code

    `cd personalized-email-frontend`

2.  Install Dependencies:

    Install the required Node.js packages using npm or Yarn:

    shellCopy code

    `npm install
    # or
    yarn`

3.  Run the Frontend:

    Start the development server to run the frontend:

    shellCopy code

    `npm start
    # or
    yarn start`

    The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

Usage
-----

The frontend provides a simple user interface for generating personalized emails. Users can input their email prompts, and the backend will generate email content based on the provided prompts. The results can be viewed on the "Generated Email" page.

Folder Structure
----------------

The frontend code is organized into components. Key components include:

-   `App.js`: The main application component that handles routing and communication with the backend.
-   `Main.js`: The component responsible for collecting email prompts and generating emails.
-   `GeneratedEmailPage.js`: The component for displaying generated email content.
-   `Header.js`, `Footer.js`: Components for the header and footer of the application.
-   `FollowUpInput.js`: Component for entering follow-up questions.
-   `PromptInput.js`: Component for entering initial email prompts.
-   `RecipientList.js`, `RecipientChip.js`: Components for managing email recipients.
-   `EmailTemplate.js`: Component that provides a basic structure for the application.

Deployment
----------

To deploy the frontend, you can use various hosting services. Make sure to update the backend API URL in `App.js` to match the location of your backend.

For example, if you decide to deploy both the frontend and backend on AWS, you can configure CORS settings in your FastAPI backend to allow requests from your frontend domain.a
